## Java Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Classes and Objects

In Java, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. For example, consider the class `Book`. This class can be thought of as a blueprint for what a book is and what operations can be performed on it. An actual book, like "Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen", is an instance or an object of the `Book` class.

### Attributes and Methods

**Attributes** (also known as fields or properties) represent the data or state of an object. For the `Book` class, attributes might include `title`, `author`, and `ISBN`.

**Methods** represent the actions that can be performed on or by the object. For example, the `Book` class might have methods to `checkout` a book or `return` it.

### Constructors

A **constructor** in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. It's called when an object of the class is created.

### Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental principles of OOP. It means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. In Java, this is achieved using private attributes and public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify those attributes.

### Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a mechanism where you can create a new class based on an existing class. The new class inherits attributes and methods from the existing class.

### Geometry Classes: Circle, Square, and Triangle

These classes represent geometric shapes. Each shape has attributes, like `radius` for a circle or `side` for a square. The methods in these classes, like calculating area or perimeter, are based on geometric principles.

### Academic Classes: Student and Course

In the academic realm, the `Student` class represents a student with attributes like a name and ID. The `Course` class can represent an academic course, with methods to manage students enrolled in the course.
